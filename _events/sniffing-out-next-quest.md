## Faction Goals and Actions
### Aghara
The Aghara is currently preparing for their attack on King George's birthday celebration. The majority of their resources, specifically weapons and arms, are being moved to the City's Crest safehouse. Their attack will take place along the Parade route just within City's Crest.

### CoB
[**The Nobleman**]({{site.baseurl}}/npcs/jacob-grisdale/) is conducting a sweep of the tunnels. The rest are information gathering and attempting to locate the other Aghara safehouses and confirm their next steps.

[**The Informant**]({{site.baseurl}}/npcs/eleanor-drogues/) is currently trying to change the plans for the parade and increase King George's security.

[**The Squire**]({{site.baseurl}}/npcs/kendra-kine/) is investigating The Stadium & Maxwell Brood to see if the Hydra fiasco was an inside job or if there are more safety concerns.

[**The Professor**]({{site.baseurl}}/npcs/jahllan-kaved/) is waiting on Marcus to check in.

### Guards
The Guard is currently locking down [The Bloody Dagger]({{site.baseurl}}/stores/the-bloody-dagger/) as well as the [Aghara]({{site.baseurl}}/factions/aghara) safehouse below it. They plan on tearing it apart and examining every piece of it to try and find any information about the Aghara, their plans, and any links to the other safehouses.

Guards within the District of the Divine have been reporting an increase in residential break ins. Report to [Sergeant Drell]({{site.baseurl}}/npcs/sergeant-drell/)

### Stadium
Recovering from Aghara sabotage and prepping for games.

After losing two safehouses, the Aghara are looking to distract the guard and PCs and cause some chaos to cover their plans. They plan on sabotaging the Stadium's delivery of beasts and releasing them into the town.

### CoB
The Seafarer is working with the PCs to handle the Stadium issue at the docs. The Nobleman is conducting a sweep of the tunnels. The rest are information gathering and attempting to locate the other Aghara safehouses and confirm their next steps.

### Guards
The Guard is currently locking down [The Bloody Dagger]({{site.baseurl}}/stores/the-bloody-dagger/) as well as the [Aghara]({{site.baseurl/factions/aghara}}) safehouse below it. They plan on tearing it apart and examining every piece of it to try and find any information about the Aghara, their plans, and any links to the other safehouses.

### Stadium

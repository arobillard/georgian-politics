## Faction Goals and Actions
### Aghara
The Aghara is currently preparing for their attack on King George's birthday celebration. The majority of their resources, specifically weapons and arms, are being moved to the City's Crest safehouse.

After losing two safehouses, the Aghara are looking to distract the guard and PCs and cause some chaos to cover their plans. They plan on sabotaging the Stadium's delivery of beasts and releasing them into the town.

### CoB
The Scarecrow, The Salesman, and a collection of Protectors are participating in the raid of [The Bloody Dagger]({{site.baseurl}}/stores/the-bloody-dagger/). The other council members are gathering at the CoB headquarters for a meeting.

The Scarecrow and The Salesman are prepared to induct the PCs into the CoB.

### Guards
The Guard is currently locking down [The Bloody Dagger]({{site.baseurl}}/stores/the-bloody-dagger/) as well as the [Aghara]({{site.baseurl/factions/aghara}}) safehouse below it. They plan on tearing it apart and examining every piece of it to try and find any information about the Aghara, their plans, and any links to the other safehouses.

### Stadium
The stadium's monster shipment was attacked.The crew that was responsible for safely bringing in a number of dangerous monsters for the upcoming Midsummer Harvest Festival Games were attacked and killed and the monsters are missing.

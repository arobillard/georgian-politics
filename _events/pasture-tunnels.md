## Faction Goals and Actions
### Aghara
The Aghara is currently preparing for their attack on King George's birthday celebration.

## Outline
### Farm Runners Check-In
- The runners you sent on Initum return on Inter (4th day) with varying degrees of information.
- There are hundreds of farms and only 15 dead/captured Aghara agents
- The runners discovered 8 instances of no-shows at the beginning of the worker rotation (condensed info found [here](../runner-info.txt)):
  - **Brule** (human male) - lives in The Basin. Has been working on and off at at Kel's wheat farm for the past few years. Has missed a rotation before but it is uncommon.
    - Got piss drunk while watching the stadium events and hurt himself. Healing at Healing Waters.
  - **Jenn** (half-elf female) - lives in The Basin. Worked for the Huntington apple orchard for 4 years. Never missed a rotation.
    - Her mother passed away suddenly on Requies and was too preoccupied to send word right away, has since done so.
  - **Kyran** (human male) - lives in The Basin. Has bounced around from farm to farm, but at the current produce farm he is employed by (Yulile farms) has been a good worker with no issues.
    - **Aghara member**, his residence has no evidence.
  - **Niles** (dwarven female) - lives in The Basin. Frequent shift misser. Phoenix Farms assumes she is drunk in a gutter and will show up halfway through rotation.
    - Does exactly that
  - **Lyneer** (half-elf female) - lives in The Basin. A pretty decent worker, relatively new to Avena Farms, been there a few months and has only missed one shift before.
    - **Aghara member**, evidence in residence in the form of a letter in Deep Speech featuring the Aghara mark and a few prototype hoods.
    > Begin the attack when The Market is at its fullest on Domus morning. We want to make as big of an impact as possible when revealing ourselves to the city. The Market is an institution that bleeds our fellow citizens dry of their hard earned wealth and it must be the first domino to fall in our glorious revolution.
    >
    > Once this first stage is carried out, we must continue on to stage two. The items required for that joyous occasion will be arriving on the 18th of Flamerule. If you prove yourself in this venture, we will welcome you deeper into our fold and you will be among the first to experience true freedom!

    - Lyneer lives in a small, cheap, city-owned apartment deep in The Basin. She lives alone, and her neighbours don't know anything about her other than she is quiet and often gone on farm rotations.
    - There is a sewer access grate right behind her building which she uses to access the sewers and travel to different areas of the city to remain undetected.
  - **Gunda** (female human) - lives in The Basin. Older woman that has been working at Hillcrest farms for decades. Rarely misses a shift and when she does, finds a replacement.
    - Died in he sleep overnight.
  - **Rolland** (male half-elf) - lives in Mid-Court. Pretty young guy, only has done one rotation so far at Sundance Ranch but seemed pretty lazy. They assume he just bailed.
    - Back in his parents' basement.
  - **Tion** (male human) - lives in The Basin. Average farm hand. Been on Tisan Farms for a number of months. Considered kind of an asshole and complainer, but gets his work done.
    - **Aghara member**, keeps a journal, which outlines his complaints about elites and feeling taken advantage of for all his hard work. The journal features a large, poorly handmade version of the Aghara symbol on the cover.
    > **Ches 15**
    >
    > I was at the pub today and met a couple other farm hands who are also feeling like they are wasting their lives working the fields. We are gonna meet up again after the next rotation and talk about what we can do about it.

      > **Ches 26**
      >
      > This meeting ended up having a whole big crew of people at it. I knew this city was corrupt and serving the rich but I didn't realize so many people had finally started to see it!

      > **Tarsakh 12**
      >
      > My fucking boss on the farm is unbelievable. That piece of shit thinks he is so much better than us just because he owns a farm. We are supposed to ALL be equal! I can't wait until he get his comeuppance.

      > **Mirtul 22**
      >
      > I've heard Propova speak for the first time! What a vision for our freedom and future of this city! I cannot wait for the revolution to begin!

      > **Kythorn 18**
      >
      > I have been chosen to participate in the first stage of the revolution! I cannot believe that in a few short weeks I will be one of the first to bring glorious freedom to this city!

    - Tion lives alone in a cheap, city-owned apartment alone. He is not well liked by his neighbours and frequently drank at [The Bloody Dagger]({{site.baseurl}}/stores/the-bloody-dagger/) and would come home loud and drunk at all hours of the night.

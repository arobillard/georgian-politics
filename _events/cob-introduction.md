## Outline
### End of Fight
- CoB agents led by [Evander]({{site.baseurl}}/npcs/evander-montgomery/) & [Eugenie]({{site.baseurl}}/npcs/eugenie-huntington/) arrive
  - Evander wears a mask with a large smile with golden engravings
  - Eugenie wears a half mask that is decorated to look like it is made of straw, creating a visual of a scarecrow.

### CoB Debrief
- most members scatter after fight
- Double tap broach and their outfits shift back to normal street clothing.
- They encourage you to leave before the Guard show up
  - if PCs don't want to they'll bail and tell them to meet them at The Hunter's Tophy the following day and say to the orc barman Jay "I have some high quality goods that need to be sold, and am looking for a salesmen up to the task."
- Evander and Eugenie lead you to a back room in The Hunter's Trophy
- Give overview of [Council of the Bruins]({{site.baseurl}}/factions/council-of-the-bruins/)
  - pull up left sleeve, rub underside of forearm three times and reveal CoB crest tattoos
  > We represent a secret society within Port George, known as the Council of the Bruins. We fight in secret to maintain balance within the city and help to insure it remains a peaceful and safe city.
  >
  > We are no city guard, nor agents of the King. We are completely independent and have representatives in all of the Districts to ensure everyone is treated fairly and everyones' needs are met.
  >
  > As we are sure you are aware, we have been keeping tabs on you since Evander first encountered you in the Market. We hope to find that our goals are aligned and that we might be able to work together to end these Aghara terrorists.

- Mention they have been tracking the Aghara for a little while, but were caught unawares by the market attack.
  > We knew there was some growing unrest in some of laborers and lower-income workers around the city, especially amongst the farmworkers. The combination of the fact that work is hard and the job stability and pay isn't always great and some of the farm owners and supervisors aren't the most empathetic bosses has led to some, to this point, minor conflicts.

- They had seemed mostly small fry, sticking to attacks in The Pastures
- Tonight is the closest they have gotten to discovering who the leaders are
  - they have captured a few low level guys but they keep dying whenever they start giving up information
- Looking to get any information that the group may have on the Aghara
- If the PCs need to contact the CoB they can talk to the orc barman Jay and tell him "I have some high quality goods that need to be sold, and am looking for a salesmen up to the task", the code phrase will inform Jay to contact Evander right away.

### Farm Runners Check-In
- The runners you sent on Initum return on Inter (4th day) with varying degrees of information.
- There are hundreds of farms and only 15 dead/captured Aghara agents
- The runners discovered 8 instances of no-shows at the beginning of the worker rotation (condensed info found [here](../runner-info.txt)):
  - **Brule** (human male) - lives in The Basin. Has been working on and off at at Kel's wheat farm for the past few years. Has missed a rotation before but it is uncommon.
    - Got piss drunk while watching the stadium events and hurt himself. Healing at Healing Waters.
  - **Jenn** (half-elf female) - lives in The Basin. Worked for the Huntington apple orchard for 4 years. Never missed a rotation.
    - Her mother passed away suddenly on Requies and was too preoccupied to send word right away, has since done so.
  - **Kyran** (human male) - lives in The Basin. Has bounced around from farm to farm, but at the current produce farm he is employed by (Yulile farms) has been a good worker with no issues.
    - **Aghara member**, his residence has no evidence.
  - **Niles** (dwarven female) - lives in The Basin. Frequent shift misser. Phoenix Farms assumes he is drunk in a gutter and will show up halfway through rotation.
    - Does exactly that
  - **Lyneer** (half-elf female) - lives in The Basin. A pretty decent worker, relatively new to Avena Farms, been there a few months and has only missed one shift before.
    - **Aghara member**, evidence in residence in the form of a letter in Deep Speech featuring the Aghara mark and a few prototype hoods.
    > Begin the attack when The Market is at its fullest on Domus morning. We want to make as big of an impact as possible when revealing ourselves to the city. The Market is an institution that bleeds our fellow citizens dry of their hard earned wealth and it must be the first domino to fall in our glorious revolution.
    >
    > Once this first stage is carried out, we must continue on to stage two. The items required for that joyous occasion will be arriving on the 18th of Flamerule. If you prove yourself in this venture, we will welcome you deeper into our fold and you will be among the first to experience true freedom!

    - Lyneer lives in a small, cheap, city-owned apartment deep in The Basin. She lives alone, and her neighbours don't know anything about her other than she is quiet and often gone on farm rotations.
    - There is a sewer access grate right behind her building which she uses to access the sewers and travel to different areas of the city to remain undetected.
  - **Gunda** (female human) - lives in The Basin. Older woman that has been working at Hillcrest farms for decades. Rarely misses a shift and when she does, finds a replacement.
    - Died in he sleep overnight.
  - **Rolland** (male half-elf) - lives in Mid-Court. Pretty young guy, only has done one rotation so far at Sundance Ranch but seemed pretty lazy. They assume he just bailed.
    - Back in his parents' basement.
  - **Tion** (male human) - lives in The Basin. Average farm hand. Been on Tisan Farms for a number of months. Considered kind of an asshole and complainer, but gets his work done.
    - **Aghara member**, keeps a journal, which outlines his complaints about elites and feeling taken advantage of for all his hard work. The journal features a large, poorly handmade version of the Aghara symbol on the cover.
    > **Ches 15**
    >
    > I was at the pub today and met a couple other farm hands who are also feeling like they are wasting their lives working the fields. We are gonna meet up again after the next rotation and talk about what we can do about it.

      > **Ches 26**
      >
      > This meeting ended up having a whole big crew of people at it. I knew this city was corrupt and serving the rich but I didn't realize so many people had finally started to see it!

      > **Tarsakh 12**
      >
      > My fucking boss on the farm is unbelievable. That piece of shit thinks he is so much better than us just because he owns a farm. We are supposed to ALL be equal! I can't wait until he get his comeuppance.

      > **Mirtul 22**
      >
      > I've heard Propova speak for the first time! What a vision for our freedom and future of this city! I cannot wait for the revolution to begin!

      > **Kythorn 18**
      >
      > I have been chosen to participate in the first stage of the revolution! I cannot believe that in a few short weeks I will be one of the first to bring glorious freedom to this city!

    - Tion lives alone in a cheap, city-owned apartment alone. He is not well liked by his neighbours and frequently drank at [The Bloody Dagger]({{site.baseurl}}/stores/the-bloody-dagger/) and would come home loud and drunk at all hours of the night.

### The Sting
- **CoB Help**
  - CoB want to help set up a sting.
  - They can provide a special cart that can be used to disguise the PCs and allow them to be bait.
- **Aghara Underground Staging Area**

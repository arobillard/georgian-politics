      It is a beautiful, sunny <mark>Saturday</mark> morning. The Market is extra busy this morning as it is <mark>Saturday</mark> morning, during which time much of the rest of the city is shut down and the locals flock do their personal shopping. It is about half way through the summer season and the first major crop of the season from [The Pastures](/locations/port-george/districts/the-pastures/) are being sold at bargain prices from stalls. The sounds of bartering, bustling crowds, and pack animals fills the air.

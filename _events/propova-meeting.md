    > Hello fellow citizens, I am happy you decided to attend this meeting. I am Propova. I lead the Aghara in the liberation of Port George. Come I wish to tell you about my dream!
    >
    > I dream of a free city. A city where all are equal. Where everyone is given the same chance to live and be successful and be free. Doesn't that sound wonderful?
    >
    > King George and the elite of this city sit atop their hill and look down on us all, claiming that their system and their "progress" provides us with opportunity and purpose. They lie.
    >
    > Their "progress" has done nothing but tighten our shackles. We continue to work and sweat day after day for **THEM**. To put money in **THEIR** pockets. To further **THEIR** goals. They care nothing for the dreams of common citizens.
    >
    > But I do. I care deeply for the dreams of every citizen. I wish to give everyone an equal chance to achieve their dreams.
    >
    > To achieve this we must make the playing field equal. We must remove our shackles and the institutions that have placed them upon us.
    >
    > I wish for you to join me in my quest. Help me to bring sight to those who have been blinded by these lies. Help me to tear down these systems of oppression.

  - Looking to get any information that the group may have on the Aghara

-- Kyran (human male)
Lives in The Basin. Has bounced around from farm to farm, but at the current produce farm he is employed by (Yulile farms) has been a good worker with no issues.

-- Niles (dwarven female)
Lives in The Basin. Frequent shift misser. Phoenix Farms assumes he is drunk in a gutter and will show up halfway through rotation.

Lives in The Basin. A pretty decent worker, relatively new to Avena Farms, been there a few months and has only missed one shift before.

-- Gunda (female human)

-- Rolland (male half-elf)
Lives in Mid-Court. Pretty young guy, only has done one rotation so far at Sundance Ranch but seemed pretty lazy. They assume he just bailed.

-- Tion (male human)
Lives in The Basin. Average farm hand. Been on Tisan Farms for a number of months. Considered kind of an asshole and complainer, but gets his work done.

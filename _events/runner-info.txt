- Brule (human male) - lives in The Basin. Has been working on and off at the same wheat farm for the past few years. Has missed a rotation before but it is uncommon.
- Jenn (half-elf female) - lives in The Basin. Worked for the same apple orchard for 4 years. Never missed a rotation.
- Kyran (human male) - lives in The Basin. Has bounced around from farm to farm, but at the current produce farm he is employed by has been a good worker with no issues.
- Niles (dwarven female) - lives in The Basin. Frequent shift misser. They assume he is drunk in a gutter and will show up halfway through rotation.
- Lyneer (half-elf female) - lives in The Basin. A pretty decent worker, new to the farm she is currently at and has only missed one shift before.
- Gunda (female human) - lives in The Basin. Older woman that has been working at the same farm for decades. Rarely misses a shift and when she does, finds a replacement.
- Rolland (male half-elf) - lives in Mid-Court. Pretty young guy, only has done one rotation so far but seemed pretty lazy. They assume he just bailed.
- Tion (male human) - lives in The Basin. Average farm hand. Been on the current farm for a number of months. Considered kind of an asshole and complainer, but gets his work done.

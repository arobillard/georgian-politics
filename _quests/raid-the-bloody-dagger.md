## Introduction
During the interrogations of the captured [Aghara]({{site.baseurl}}/factions/aghara/) members, [The Bloody Dagger]({{site.baseurl}}/stores/the-bloody-dagger/) kept coming up. [Captain Lionel Deep]({{site.baseurl}}/npcs/captain-lionel-deep/) has decided there is enough cause to raid the bar and discover if the Aghara are using it as some sort of base of operations within the city.

## Introduction
This location serves as the research and development area for the [Aghara]({{site.baseurl}}/factions/aghara). It is located beneath and attached to a large manor home within [Scholar's Row]({{site.baseurl}}/locations/scholars-row) owned by [Letwoon]({{site.baseurl}}//npcs/letwoon). The house and base are both heavily trapped, both through mechanical and arcane means.

#### 6 Study
The majority of the walls in this room are covered in bookcases. The books cover countless topics of arcane theory and experimentation.

The centre of the room features a large arcane circle. The outside of the circle features symbols of most of the schools of magic (Abjuration (1), Transmutation (6), Divination (3), Conjuration (2), Evocation (4), Illusion (5)) however all are dulled except for Abjuration. The inner arcane symbols translate to multiply, combine, and empower.

#### 7 Hidden Study
This room features even more bookcases. These  books focus more on harnessing and combining magics of different sources. There are also a number of papers and scrolls on a large desk. These feature research notes and scribbles in a coded language. Some arcane symbols are repeatedly used, specifically conjuration and transmutation. However to properly read the notes, an arcane caster must succeed on a DC 25 Intelligence/Arcana check and spend at least 4 hours to decipher it.

The notes detail research into harnessing powerful magic from innately magical beings such as fey creature, devils, and demons, and transferring them to more common creatures with the goal of transeffering them permenantly to humans. It appears there has been no clear, permenant success, but there has been a few "partial successes" and numerous disasterous failures.

## Introduction
This location serves as the research and development area for the [Aghara]({{site.baseurl}}/factions/aghara). It is located beneath and attached to a large manor home within [Scholar's Row]({{site.baseurl}}/locations/scholars-row) owned by [Letwoon]({{site.baseurl}}//npcs/letwoon). The house and base are both heavily trapped, both through mechanical and arcane means.


## Rooms

### Secret Lab Level 1

#### Spiral Stairs
This circular is filled with a sprial staircase leading downwards. There is a short hallway and door to the east and west, east leading to the experiment room and west to the sewers.

The third stair is a trick stair. Anyone how stands on it triggers an arcance trap turning the staircase into a slide sending all within the stair room down to the [lowest level](#aghara-safehouse).

#### Experiment Room
This room is a 60' diameter circular room. There are doors to the east and south. Along the walls on the western half are a number of desks piled with a wild assortment of papers, books, and strange metal instruments. In the south east section of the room are two large metal cages. The center of the room is filled with a 20' diameter arcane circle, the center of which is coated in dark, dried blood.

Desks: more notes on the various experiments. One set of notes, dated yesterday, outlines the first "successful" binding and citing the role of vibrant platinum in the arcane binding process. A attunement rod made from obsidian, attuned to the 9 Hells

#### Secret Study
This room features even more bookcases. These  books focus more on harnessing and combining magics of different sources. There are also a number of papers and scrolls on a large desk. These feature research notes and scribbles in a coded language. Some arcane symbols are repeatedly used, specifically conjuration and transmutation. However to properly read the notes, an arcane caster must succeed on a DC 25 Intelligence/Arcana check and spend at least 4 hours to decipher it.

The notes detail research into harnessing powerful magic from innately magical beings such as fey creature, devils, and demons, and transferring them to more common creatures with the goal of transeffering them permenantly to humans. It appears there has been no clear, permenant success, but there has been a few "partial successes" and numerous disasterous failures.

### Secret Lab Level 2

#### Arance Material Storage
Contains a variety of materials used for arcane research:
- empty flasks/vials
- containers of specialized chalk for rituals
- incense
- number of glass containers filled with blood

#### Garden

#### 6 Study
The majority of the walls in this room are covered in bookcases. The books cover countless topics of arcane theory and experimentation.

The centre of the room features a large arcane circle. The outside of the circle features symbols of most of the schools of magic (Abjuration (1), Transmutation (6), Divination (3), Conjuration (2), Evocation (4), Illusion (5)) however all are dulled except for Abjuration. The inner arcane symbols translate to multiply, combine, and empower. Pressing the symbols in alphabetical order will open a secret door in the bookcases which lead down to the secret laboratory.

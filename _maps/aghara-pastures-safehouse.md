  ### 2 - Staging Room, Tunnel B
  A small cave-like room featuring a table with a few chairs. There are a couple mostly empty barrels of oil at the back of the room, as well as <span class="text-primary bold">1d6 empty bottles</span> and various scraps of clothes. There is currently no one in the room.

  ### 3 - Warehouse
  This room is 60x40ft and is well light and properly built with stone walls, floor and ceiling. It appears to be a storage facility, there are numerous boxes, crates, and barrels in various states of being packed, unpacked, and organized. There is a heavy metal on the south wall to the east and a large set of double doors on the south wall to the west. On the west wall is a second set of double doors.

  The crates contain food, construction and mining supplies (stamped with a variety of businesses, they were likely stolen in small batches to avoid notice), basic weapons and arms.

  ### 3b - Teleportation Circle Room
  This room is also mostly filled with crates, boxes, and barrels, although much more neatly packed and seem ready to be shipped. The contents are similar as to the main warehouse.

  At the southern end of the room is a teleportation circle. The teleportation circle glows a deep red and at the centre of the sigil markings is a bright glowing mark of the Aghara. In order to pass through the teleportation circle, one must be branded by the Aghara. Anyone who attempts to step into it without a brand must make a DC 20 Constitution ST. On a failed save, suffer 4d6 Force damage or half as much on a success.

  ### 4 - Vault
  The vault is sealed by a large metal door. It requires a DC 18 Thieves Tools check or use of the key held by the Knight in order to open. The vault contains the following:
  - 6 gems worth 25gp
  - 400cp, 8,000sp, 2,200gp, 70pp
  - Potion of Invisibility
  - Potion of Greater Healing

  ### 5 - Hallway

  ### 6 - Barracks
  Across the 4 rooms is enough bedding for approximately 120 people. A keen observer (DC 15 Investigation check) will notice that the majority of the beds have yet to be used. A thorough search of a few of the rooms will uncover <span class="text-primary bold">4d6gp</span> worth of silver pieces, various bits of common clothing, and 2 daggers.

  ### 7 - Mess Hall
  A large mess hall. It appears that the cooking area is not fully complete in its construction. However, when complete it looks like it would have the capacity to easily feed the amount of people this shelter can house. Barrels and crates of food can be found along the east wall and a modest meal for the current residents is in the process of being prepared.

  ### 8 - Knight's Quarters
  This room features a desk, a table with a couple chairs, a mostly empty bookcase, a modest, but comfortable bed, and empty armour stand, and a chest. The bookcase contains a few general history books of the area, a book titled "An Argument for Freedom" by Elnullia, and a few engineering and mining books. The chest is mostly clothing of mid-level quality and a pouch of <span class="text-primary bold">50gp</span>. The table has the remains of a meal. On the desk is a journal and a half- written letter. The journal contains logs of the various wares that have come through the warehouse recently. It lists items they have stolen in small bunches from nearby farms, traveling caravans, and different shops from around the pastures. It outlines how they steal small amounts of goods from carts amidst the chaos of burning and attacking the wagons. Their goal seemed to be to mask the fact that they were stockpiling goods and make it seem like they were merely burning everything. The half-written letter is written in <span class="text-primary bold">Deep Speech</span> and reads:

  > Propova,
  >
  > We are working on the final touches of the construction of the <mark>southwest</mark> Pastures safehouse. It should be complete within the next few days and ready to serve its full capacity at that time.
  >
  > We are nearly ready for the next stage of the plan. This letter arrives with the final shipment of weapons and resources necessary for the attack. Once they are sent and I have completed final preparations here, I will meet...

A small cave-like room featuring a table with a few chairs. A deck of cards in mid game lays spread on the table as well as <span class="text-primary bold">3d6 x 10sp</span>. There are a couple mostly empty barrels of oil at the back of the room, as well as <span class="text-primary bold">1d6 empty bottles</span> and various scraps of clothes.

There are two training dummies along the east wall towards the south end of the room as well as a sparring circle. In the south west corner are crates and barrels filled with basic provisions, some low end ale, and the spoils from recent caravan raids. Among the provisions is a large boulder which is actually a *Galeb Duhr*. The *Galeb Duhr* is used to transport goods within the tunnels. Within the room is also 5 Aghara members, two Fanatics, and three cultists. They are performing various activities from sparring, to eating, to playing games at the table, to asleep in the room.

### C - Guard Rooms
A circular, cave-like room lit by a torch at each of its 3/4 tunnel entrances. In this room are contraptions that appear to be pedestals with crossbows mounted on top, as well as a few crates. Two figures sit on the crates, casually chatting and seem to be playing a dice game. At their feet sits a grey wolf.

The two pedestals are crank-operated, quick-fire, light crossbow turrets. They can turn 180 degrees on a swivel and can be fired twice per round. A successful Investigation check of 10 is required to operate and a check above an 15 allows the user to add their proficiency bonus when attacking. The base attack is +5 to hit 1d8 + 2 piercing damage.

## Main Structure

### 1 - The Kennel
> This room is dark. When you open the door you can smell a heavy odour of damp fur and hear growling from what seems to be multiple large beasts.

This 25x30' room features eight large steel cages. Six of the cages feature *Dire Wolves*, which begin to bark and attempt to break free of their cages if approached. However, they are securely locked and unable to escape. There are barrels in the southwest corner that are filled with meats for feeding. Feeding the *Dire Wolves* will quiet them.

### 2 - Warehouse

At the southern end of the room is a teleportation circle. The teleportation circle glows a deep red and at the centre of the sigil markings is a bright glowing mark of the Aghara. In order to pass through the teleportation circle, one must be branded by the Aghara. Anyone who attempts to step into it without a brand is thrown backwards 10ft and must make a DC 20 Constitution ST, suffering 4d6 Force damage on a failed save or half as much on a success.

### 4 - Armory
This room is filled with a collection of weapons and armour. Roll an Investigation check. The difficulty check for finding a complete set of armour is the AC of the armour +2 for medium armour and +5 for heavy armour. A natural 20 is required to find a full set of Plate. The weapons available are all basic weapon types, nothing fancy.  

### 5 - Vault

This room features a desk, a large conference style table with chairs, a mostly empty bookcase, a comfortable bed, a dresser, and a chest. The bookcase contains a few general history books of the area, a book titled "An Argument for Freedom" by Elnullia, a few engineering and mining books, a few books on military strategy and a large number of books containing logs of items. An Investigation check of 15 reveals a hidden lever beneath a book that opens a secret door. The chest is mostly clothing of mid-level quality and a pouch of <span class="text-primary bold">50gp</span>. The table has the remains of a meal. On the desk is a log book and a half- written letter. The log book lists items they have stolen in small bunches from nearby farms, traveling caravans, and different shops from around the pastures. It outlines how they steal small amounts of goods from carts amidst the chaos of burning and attacking the wagons. Their goal seemed to be to mask the fact that they were stockpiling goods and make it seem like they were merely burning everything. It also also indicates that a collection of shipments that are destined for four different destinations are nearly ready to be shipped out. It lists the destinations as Pucina (Shoreline), Skola (Scholar's Row), Vrh( City's Crest) and Sliv (The Basin).

The half-written letter is written in <span class="text-primary bold">Deep Speech</span> and reads:

> Propova,
>
> We are working on the final touches of the construction of the <mark>southwest</mark> Polje safehouse. It should be complete within the next few days and ready to serve its full capacity at that time.
>
> We are nearly ready for the next stage of the plan. This letter arrives with the final shipment of weapons and resources necessary for the celebration. Once they are sent and I have completed final preparations here, I will meet...

### 7 - Laboratory
This room features a large desk covered in books and research notes, numerous bookshelves, and an alchemical workbench covered in class tubes and vials, materials, and dangerous liquids. At the west end of the room is a deep red teleportation circle with an Aghara symbol at its centre. It works in the same way as the teleportation circle in the [Teleportation Circle Room](#3---teleportation-circle-room).

The research notes are written in *Deep Speech* and in a very difficult code. It requires a DC 25 Investigation check by someone skilled in Arcana or Alchemist's Tools. The notes detail research into weaponized alchemical toxins and weapons that cause a variety of effects from fear inducing inhalants, to deadly burning acids, to fire that cannot be put out. It is clear from the research, that the alchemist was capable of developing very potent and dangerous alchemical mixtures.

There are 5 full corked vials on the alchemical workbench.
- Bright green liquid: basic vial of acid
- Clear liquid: highly potent vial of acid. Has no effect on non-organic matter. Causes 1d10 acid damage per round until an action is taken to clean off the acid. Causes permanent scaring and failed death saving throws if still in contact with skin while unconscious.
- Opaque black liquid: smoke bomb. Creates a 10ft radius of magical darkness centered around point where the vial impacts and breaks.
- Bright blue liquid: creeping fire. On impact, creates blue magical fire in a 5ft radius. Each round the radius grows by 5ft regardless of whether there are flammable materials. Can only be put out by a dispell magic spell or by smothering with copious amounts of non-flammable materials.
- Muddy brown liquid: failed experiment.

### 8 - Mess Hall
A mess hall with a number of tables and chairs as well as a long counter to prepare food on. There are barrels and crates of food can be found along the west wall and a modest meal for the current residents looks half eaten on the table.

### 9 - Barracks
Across the 7 rooms is enough bedding for approximately 150 people. A keen observer (DC 15 Investigation check) will notice that the majority of the beds have yet to be used. A thorough search of a few of the rooms will uncover <span class="text-primary bold">4d6gp</span> worth of silver pieces, various bits of common clothing, and 2 daggers.

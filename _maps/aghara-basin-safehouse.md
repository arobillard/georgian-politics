## Introduction
This location serves as the main recruitment area for the [Aghara]({{site.baseurl}}/factions/aghara).  By being located beneath the [The Bloody Dagger]({{site.baseurl}}/stores/the-bloody-dagger/) they have easy access to the main target audience for their recruitment.


## Rooms

### 1 - Entrance Hall & Training Grounds
This room has a 50' by 40' entrance area before opening up to a larger open 70' by 80' area. The first area has a door on the north wall and a door on the south wall.

The larger area is composed mainly of a training ground that features a number of fighting dummies, racks with wooden swords, a few targets for throwing knives, and a wrestling pit. On the north wall, there is a painted mural of Propova standing triumphantly with a raised fist, surrounded by a large group of masked Aghara supporters. In the larger area there are small doors on the north and south walls as well as a large door on the west wall. The large door is made of solid dark wood covered in plates of dark iron that create the Aghara symbol as well as runes in <span class="text-primary bold">Deep Speech</span> which read "Those who follow blindly will never achieve liberty."

### 2 - Barracks & Mess Hall
The barracks consists of 3 rooms each which can house around 10 people tightly in bunks and hammocks. These rooms look well lived in and quite dirty. A thorough search of a few of the rooms will uncover <span class="text-primary bold">4d6gp</span> worth of silver pieces, various bits of common clothing, and a DC 20 Investigation check will allow the searcher to roll the Trinkets Table.

The mess hall is small but fairly well equipped to feed the safehouse's inhabitants. There are a few tables with the remains of the nights meal.

### 3 - Storage & Teleportation Room
This 60' by 80' room has a large number of storage containers and goods organized into four distinct groupings. In the centre of the room is a platform upon which are four teleportation circles. Three of which are glowing a deep red, and one which appears to no longer be active. The active teleportation cicles are label Pucina, Skola, and Vrh and the inactive one is labeled Polje. There are two Cult Fanatics as well as four Cultists currently sorting and organizing goods.

### 4 - Church
This 125' x 100' room is a large church. There are eight rows of stone pews that face toward a large raised platform with a stone alter. The wall behind the alter features a large 20' carved mural of the Aghara symbol. This symbol differs from the regular Aghara symbol however. While it has the same shape, this version has a number of detailed carvings, patterns, and symbols within the main Aghara symbol.

Standing behind the alter is a priest in black robes. Her arms are stretched wide as she preaches towards those assembled in the church. Behind her are two more black cloaked figures who seem to be ready to aid in her service. In front of the alter kneels a cult member with their head bowed. Standing over them, with a red glowing hand held to the back of the cultist's neck stands a mage in black robes. Most of the pews are empty, however the first few rows seem to have 10-15 people sitting in them.

### 5 - Assistants' Room
This room features four beds, chests, and small writing tables.

### 6 - Mandrina's Study
This room features a lavish bed, a large desk, a series of bookcases, and a chest. The chest contains a number of priest robes, common clothing and <span class="text-primary bold">100gp</span> and <span class="text-primary bold">15pp</span>. The bookcase contains a few general history books of the area, a collection of philosophy books including "An Argument for Freedom" by Elnullia, a few public speaking books, a few books on leadership and guidance, books on famous cults, and a large number of books containing logs of items. An Investigation check of 20 reveals a hidden lever beneath a book that opens a secret door.

On the desk is a collection of papers as well as a book on public speeking and a book on cult leaders. Most of the papers seem to be drafts of Mandrina's latest sermon, with many edits and sections scratched out. There is also a letter written in <span class="text-primary bold">Deep Speech</span> which reads:

> Mandrina,
>
> The fall of the Polje safehouse was a blow to our operation that will require correcting. I must task you with increasing your production of devotees who share in The Great Liberator's divine power. We cannot let our numbers continue to fall if we are to achieve our goal of eliminating the top target during the Midsummer Harvest Festival.
>
> We must be ready.<br>Propova

### 7 - Mandrina's Shrine
This room features an Aghara teleportation circle as well as an alter. This features many of the same symbols found within the carved Aghara mural within the church, however does not feature the Aghara symbol in any form. The main symbol within the shrine is a set of broken merchant scales. A DC 25 Religion check will reveal this to be the sign of Hiddukel, the god of Lies and Greed.

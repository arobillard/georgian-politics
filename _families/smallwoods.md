## Introduction
The Smallwoods are an old and proud family. The older members of the family are not well liked among the rest of high society as they are frequently rude and selfish, even by high-society standards. However, some of the younger family members are working to improve relationships and the family's reputation is beginning to improve.

The family owns a number of shops throughout the city and has found recent financial success through the establishment of a network of general stores on the [Farmunes]({{site.baseurl}}/locations/the-pastures/#farmunes) in The Pastures.

## Introduction
The Huntingtons are relatively new to their money. With the agricultural boom and increase in lower and middle class wealth over the past twenty years, the [Huntington Brewers](../../locations/huntington-brewers/) have become increasingly in demand and provided the family with incredible new wealth. However, in contrast to many of the wealthy elite in the city, most of the Huntingtons remain outside of the political sphere and prefer to keep to themselves on their property in [The Pastures](../../locations/the-pastures/). [Eugenie](../../npcs/eugenie-huntington/), the heir to the family fortune and business, is one of the few members who regularly seen participating in social and political affairs. She is the heir to the business and family fortune and seeks to improve the family's connections within the city.

## Relationships

### [Findren Estate](../findren/)
The [Huntington Brewers](../../locations/huntington-brewers/) and the [Findren Winerys](../../locations/findren-winery/) are direct competitors and therefore there is a fair amount of tension between the families. Although there is no open hostility, there has been a number of aggressive and sneaky business practices on both sides that have caused some bad blood.

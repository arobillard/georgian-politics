## Introduction
The Findren's are one of the oldest families in Port George. They settled on their land (which later became part of The Pastures) and built their first vineyards before Port George was officially a city-state and under the rule of the Georgian line. They were one of King George I's earliest allies and have kept their power and influence over the proceeding generations. Throughout history, they have been seen as trend setters and leaders in business and politics.

In recent years, the Findren Estate has invested a large amount of money into developing lower income areas and generating jobs and is currently in the good graces of most of the Port George residents.

## Relationships

### [Huntingtons](../huntington/)
The [Findren Winerys](../../locations/findren-winery/) and [Huntington Brewers](../../locations/huntington-brewers/) are direct competitors and therefore there is a fair amount of tension between the families. Although there is no open hostility, there has been a number of aggressive and sneaky business practices on both sides that have caused some bad blood.

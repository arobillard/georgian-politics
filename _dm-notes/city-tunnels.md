## Overview
There are a number of tunnels beneath the city that connect the various districts. The general public merely believe that the tunnels are used for sewage and drainage, which is the case for the majority of them. However, there are numerous other passages interconnecting the tunnels that have been created by a variety of groups over the city's history.

### Castle Caan
There are tunnels leading in and out of Castle Caan which were built with the utmost secrecy and used only in dire circumstances. These tunnels are very well maintained and hidden.

### Council of the Bruins
The [Council of the Bruins]({{site.baseurl}}/factions/council-of-the-bruins/) have added their own tunnels, which they use to travel the city quickly and stealthly. Their tunnels congregate in an underground meeting area directly below the [Statue of Nocea]({{site.baseurl}}/locations/the-market/#statue-of-nocea) in [The Market]({{site.baseurl}}/locations/the-market)

### Aghara
The [Aghara]({{site.baseurl}}/factions/aghara) are also using the tunnels to travel around the city more efficiently. They have expanded the tunnels in some areas and have specifically avoided the Council of the Bruins' tunnels. Their tunnels connect their four hidden bases within the city location in The Basin (Sliv), The Shoreline (Pucina), Scholar's Row (Skola), and City's Crest (Vrh). Most of the bases are freshly built specifically to serve the Aghara's goals. However, the base located within City's Crest, which is their main headquarters, is a long forgotten temple built deep below the district.

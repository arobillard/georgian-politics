  ## Goals
  The Aghara seek to disrupt the current systems with Port George. They present that they are looking to take power away from the rich and selfish and give back to the "true citizens" of Port George. However, they are secretly controlled by a more sinister crime syndicate. The {{organization}} used to make large amount of money off drugs and other crimes within the city. However, due to the increase in available jobs and food and decrease in poverty, their income has dramatically decreased. They aim to destabilize the city to create a large imbalance of power and wealth in order to once again take advantage of the city's impoverished citizens.

## Introduction
The Aghara have slowly been building in number over recent months. Mostly thought to be an unorganized group, they have been seen around town vandalizing buildings and causing mild inconveniences. Little is known about them or their goals.

## Market Attack
On the 9th of Flamerule, the Aghara led an attack on [The Market]({{site.baseurl}}/locations/the-market/), burning stalls and clashing with [City Guard](../port-george-city-guard/) and residents of the city. They vandalized the [Statue of Nocea]({{site.baseurl}}/locations/statue-of-nocea/) and spread thousands of pamphlets throughout The Market which read:

> Wake up citizens of Port George! The city's elite have lulled you into a false sense of security. They continue to get richer and more powerful while you, the people, slave daily doing the real work for the city. It is time for change. Join the Aghara in liberty!

## Introduction
When meeting with [Evander Montgomery]({{site.baseurl}}/npcs/evander-montgomery/) and [Eugenie Huntington]({{site.baseurl}}/npcs/eugenie-huntington/) they provided a the following introduction:

> We represent a secret society within Port George, known as the Council of the Bruins. We fight in secret to maintain balance within the city and help to insure it remains a peaceful and safe city.
>
> We are no city guard, nor agents of the King. We are completely independent and have representatives in all of the Districts to ensure everyone is treated fairly and everyones' needs are met.

      The Anarchists seek to disrupt the current systems with Port George. They present that they are looking to take power away from the rich and selfish and give back to the "true citizens" of Port George. However, they are secretly controlled by a more sinister crime syndicate. The {{organization}} used to make large amount of money off drugs and other crimes within the city. However, due to the increase in available jobs and food and decrease in poverty, their income has dramatically decreased. They aim to destabilize the city to create a large imbalance of power and wealth in order to once again take advantage of the city's impoverished citizens.

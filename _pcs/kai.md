    discovered: true
    content: >-
      Kai was born in a hillside town across the sea to a clan of haflings that worship Chauntea the goddess of agriculture. This clan has lived on the same land for hundreds of generations. Kai grew up with the beliefs that haflings do not leave their land, do not travel, and do not trust travellers (think similar to the Shire in Lord of the Rings). However, Kai always felt that there was something missing from her life. Once day when Kai was a teenager, she snuck away with her friends to a nearby lake. She did not know how to swim and when she fell off the boat she nearly drowned. However, while in the water Kai was visited by the goddess Nocea who saved Kai and told her that she is important and that she needed her help. Nocea told Kai that if she dedicated herself to the goddess she would ensure her life was fulfilled with knowledge and adventure, and in return Kai would help Nocea uncover the disappearance of a sacred artifact.
      The artifact disappeared in a large sea battle thousands of years ago, and if it discovered by the wrong people, it could mean the destruction of many civilizations. For the last 50 years Kai has travelled around absorbing as much knowledge about the world as she can, and trying to discern as much information on this missing artifact. This brought her to Port George 5 years ago to the Archives of the Deep, which she believes will lead to the artifacts location.

Nocea told Kai that if she dedicated herself to the goddess she would ensure her life was fulfilled with knowledge and adventure, and in return Kai would help Nocea uncover the disappearance of a sacred artifact. 

      She then presents Kai with a vision that tells Kai of an artifact that was taken from its rightful resting place. Kai gets flashes of numerous beautiful islands and open seas. And then the visions darken and the seas get rougher and storms major storms crash upon the islands. Kai then felt a wave of sadness from her as if she has lost someone close to her.

      The vision does not tell Kai what she are looking for, but Kai feel that it is important in maintaining the balance between the ocean and the land. For the last 15 years Kai has travelled around absorbing as much knowledge about the world as she can, and trying to discern as much information on this missing artifact. This brought her to Port George 5 years ago to the Archives of the Deep, which she believes will lead to the artifacts location.

      After a decade on the job, Huell had become quite well established. He could be rash and blunt to a fault, without much care for the politics or delicacy of a situation, but was also viewed as one of the most reliable guards out there. In the most dangerous situations, Huell would be the one kicking in the door and charging in first. 


      This behavior ultimately lead to his disappearance six years ago. While attempting to arrest a mage studying at the Academia del Umbra Arcana, Huell was the first to burst into the mage’s quarters. After shrugging off a few blasts of magic, and closing the distance between them, the mage panicked and fired off one last spell in desperation. Instead of grabbing the mage’s neck, Huell found himself holding a handful of snow. 


      The next few days were spent scouring the Sheyal mountain range. After reaching one peak, and seeing no landmark he recognized and feeling no sea breeze, the direness of the situation started to dawn on Huell. He continued combing the hills and valleys, foraging for food and searching for some aspect of civilization. 


      One morning, he woke in his camp to the sounds of battle on the wind. He approached cautiously, to find a retinue of soldiers fighting with a group of barbarians. Huell couldn’t recognize any of the symbols they wore. He tried to wait by the edge of the skirmish, until he watched one of the leaders thrown to the ground. The axe left his hands before he could notice, as his feet carried him across the broken ground. It caused the barbarian to pitch and turn as it dug into his back, giving enough time for the noble to let a bolt of magic loose that struck his would be executioner. Quickly cleaving another down from behind, caused the remainders to route. 


      Huell stood before the soldiers, in his tattered Port George uniform. When asked where he came from, he answered Port George. Only the noble could knew the city’s name, which he held back on when he realized its distance from Skaegal. After some deliberation, the retinue invited Huell to join them on their return to court to help answer the questions he held.


      For the next year, Huell served the Skaegal court in Haven. The noble he helped to save in the skirmish leading the soldiers, was one Marcus _______. The favor he earned from protecting him, along with his martial prowess and distant homeland, gained him some popularity with the court. He used this to serve as a guard of the castle, with the hopes of making enough connections and money to return home. 


      Even after a year spent within the castle walls, Huell had difficulty keeping track of all the families, schemes, and politics around him. However, as he stepped into the main hall during one of the feasts, he could not help but notice the tension in the air. Some seemed anxious, waiting barely on the edge of their seats. When the Lord entered the hall, Huell realized what they had been waiting for. As the Lord began to cut into the glazed boar in front of him, Huell demanded he stop as his suspicions mounted. Demanding the assistance of the Court Mage, Huell was able to confirm it was poisoned.

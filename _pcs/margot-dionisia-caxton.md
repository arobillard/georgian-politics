      *Personality - Ideals - Bonds - Flaws*


      Margot would like to have been a scholar like her brother but wasn’t given the chance. Instead, she reads as much as she can, using her trading expeditions as opportunities to learn from both books and the people who collect them. As a result, her knowledge base is wide, but not necessarily deep: though not an expert, she knows a little about most subjects.


      She is very charismatic and persuasive, convincing people to part with their treasures. But she is a merchant, not a thief. 


      Though far from famous, she is well known for her work in certain circles and always a bit surprised when collectors haven’t heard of her.


      She values loyalty, freedom, adventure, good storytelling, and knowledge for its own sake.


      Her deepest bonds are to Azafrán, to whom she feels indebted for his kindness, and to her little brother.


      She can be judgemental, sarcastic, conceited, and proud.

  - title: Backstory
    discovered: true
    content: >-
      Born into an aspiring upwardly mobile middle class family from a neighbouring city state, who paid for her to be apprenticed at 12 to Roberta Large, a wealthy mercer. The family hope that this placement would earn them wealth that they could use to buy a title of nobility. Their dearest ambition was to obtain a title for their youngest son (Margot’s stepbrother).


      When Roberta passed away four years later, one of her friends, an elvish bard and bibliophile named Azafrán, took pity on Margot and paid her for minor tasks, eventually giving her more to procure rare manuscripts for him, while also teaching her his trade. He advertised her skills to other collectors of books, antiquities and artifacts. One of these, a wizard named Algernon Blackwood, apprenticed her little brother at Academia del Umbra Arcana, to her family’s fury. Another, Lord Henry Smallwood, married her sister, fulfilling her family’s ambition.


      ### Motivation


      As a member of the Company of Merchant Adventurers of Port George, she is a procurer of rarities: mainly books, but also antiquities and other artifacts. Her clients include wealthy collectors, nobles, but also wizards, clerics, and other bards. 


      To repay Azafrán, she is looking for something stolen from his collection, a unique and vile book. He feels guilty that he didn’t protect it better and wants to remove it from circulation. He says that he won’t destroy it because he refuses to destroy knowledge. 


      ### Why is she in Port George


      Port George is the ideal location for Margot’s home base. Its position on the water allows Margot to travel by land or by sea as she conducts trade. Its political stability is conducive to her business.


      Her family has all moved there: her brother for his wizardly apprenticeship, her sister for her noble, and her parents to be near her newly-noble sister.

      ### Skægal:

      #### General Information:

      Across the ocean and to the North-East lies the kingdom of Skægal.  Skægal is divided into 3 provinces/cities: Sealand, Hinterlands and Sheyal (my home; name of the city and province). Sealand is the most populous province with one major port city: Caithen’s Port which is the main trading hub of the Kingdom. The Hinterlands has no major city and is largely populated but mobile logging/hunting groups which bring their supplies to Caithen’s Port. Sheyal is to the East and is largely mountainous.  A moderate city named Haven has sprung up around the Knuckle a large imposing Fortress (maintained by the Hammerfist family since the Kingdom was formed) protecting Skægal from the barbarians of the Icelands crossing the Diamond Peaks (the large mountain chain that separates the Icelands from Skægal).


      ##### Monarchy:
      
      Skægal has been ruled by the Ironside family since they drove the barbarians past the Diamond Peaks and seized Skægal over 800 years ago. The current ruler is king Jorund Ironside the XIIth. King Jorund’s rule has been relatively peaceful with the exception of barbarian attacks in the Diamond Peaks.


      ##### Economy:
      
      Skægal maintains good trade relations with their neighbours along the sea. Each of the provinces have their own exports, timber, furs and ivory from the local boarlike creatures inhabiting the Hinterlands; textiles and trade goods from Sealand and iron, steel, amber and gems from Sheyal. Skægal trades heavily with Port George, the dwarves and others through the ocean


      ##### Hammerfist Family
      
      The first Hammerfist of renown was Stedvan Hammerfist the First who was Jorund Ironside the First’s closest friend and supporter.  Together they helped carve out what is today Skægal after fierce fighting with the local tribes.  Peace was reached with some of the tribes while others were pushed beyond the Diamond Peaks. With the blessing of the Ironsides the Knuckle was built to protect Skægal from the tribes beyond the Peaks.  The Hammerfists have remained fiercely loyal to the Ironsides since this time and many of their members have been historically renowned for their martial prowess in defending the Kingdom.  



      **Marcus Jorund Hammerfist** is the current heir to the noble Hammerfist family and stewardship of Sheyal. He is one of 5 children born to Lord (Stedvan Hammerfist the 14th) and Lady Hammerfist.  Being second born Marcus had far less responsibility than his older brother Stedvan and was able to pursue more of his own personal interests.  In his youth Marcus was never a skilled warrior, nor martially adept and preferred instead to focus his time on stories and books instead.  This earned Marcus the ire of his father who believed that all of his children should serve the Kingdom as Hammerfists have done for generations as fighters and soldiers. Thankfully for Marcus his mother supported these endeavors until her death in giving birth to the twins Taelin and Faelin. Marcus’ life was unpleasant but manageable at that point until his elder brother Stedvan was assassinated.  Lord Hammerfist wanted Marcus to give up his literary pursuits and instead become the expected Hammerfist heir.  After a fight with his father Marcus fled the Knuckle and swore that he would find his own way to serve the Kingdom and show his family that martial service isn’t the only way to greatness.  


      Marcus has fled


      One of 5 children:


        - Stedvan Hammerfist (24M (assassinated by unknown (Marcus suspects it was ordered by one of the border states))
        - Marcus Hammerfist (22M; now heir to the Hammerfist estates)
        - Jerud Hammerfist (18M)
        - Taelin Hammerfist (13F (twin))
        - Faelin Hammerfist (13M (twin))


      Marcus is unfailingly polite but is unsure of how he is expected to behave in different situations.

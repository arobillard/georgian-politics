## Introduction
Other than the fact that he is the patriarch of the [Huntington family](../../families/huntington/) and the genius brewer behind the [Huntington Brewers](../../locations/huntington-brewers/) many popular brews, very little is publically known about Gregor Huntington. He prefers to remain out of the public eye, and is rarely seen outside of the Huntingtons' property in [The Pastures](../../locations/the-pastures/).

  Letwoon has grown annoyed and limited with the Academy's rules around research. He had hoped to expand the rules and realm of arcane research possibilities by becoming the Head of Arcane Research, but has still been heavily restricted. To combat the limitations of the Academy, he has created his own research facility in secret and has begun a number of questionable experiments.

  ## True Identity and Allegiance
  The Hand's true identity is [Eldran Welsh](../eldran-welsh) and he is a high level member of the [Pijavka](../../factions/pijavka/) gang. He is subtly controlling and manipulating Propova and the Aghara to accomplish the Pijavka's goals of destabilizing the city and creating wealth inequality that they can take advantage of.

  Only a few of the Pijavka's leaders are aware of Eldran's true identity and allegiance. Propova simply believes that he is another citizen who believes in her cause and is loyal to her.

Has been the leader of the City Guard for close to five years. Like any leader of the guard, his work has received mix reviews but overall he is considered competent and is well respected.

## Description
Mid-forties, average height, powerfully built, receding hairline, large moustache that is greying. Gives off an air of firmness and intensity.

## Personality
Firm but fair. Generally a by-the-book man, but will be lenient if he feels a second chance is warranted.

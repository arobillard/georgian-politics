Dorn is currently in custody at the [City Guard Main Barracks]({{site.baseurl}}/locations/city-guard-main-barracks/). He was arrested during the fight that followed the meeting with [Propova]({{site.baseurl}}/npcs/propova/) and is a confirmed member of the [Aghara]({{site.baseurl}}/factions/aghara/) faction. Like all of the Aghara members captured up to this point, he had a magic brand infused in his spine, which gave off an aura of conjuration and evocation. However, Marcus was able to dispell the brand's magic and allow free interrogation of Dorn.

During the interrogation, Dorn revealed that he was recruited into the Aghara by an individual named **Delwin** at the same time as a friend named **Ivor**. Ivor is a friend he met while drinking at [The Bloody Dagger]({{site.baseurl}}/stores/the-bloody-dagger/). Ivor is the one who usually provides Dorn with his instructions from the Aghara. Most of his work with the Aghara has been with the same crew of individuals recruited out of The Bloody Dagger bar. They made up the majority of the crew working the *Propova Meeting*. Beyond working the *Provova Meeting*, he has met Propova only once and thinks very highly of them. He was able to provide the location to an entrance to a network of tunnels that the Aghara use to travel around [The Pastures]({{site.baseurl}}/locations/the-pastures/) without detection.

It is clear from the interrogation that Dorn is a very low ranked member of the Aghara and is not privy to many of their secrets.

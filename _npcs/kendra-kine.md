  ## Personality
  Kendra doesn't like to debate or get into heavy discussion. However, she is not hot-tempered or hasty to make decisions. She prefers to listen to the debates happening around her and only comments when she has to or has made up her mind. She loves a good fight (and rarely loses), however generally avoids seeking unnecessary violence.

## Introduction
A member of the [Grisdale family]({{site.baseurl}}/families/grisdale/), Jacob runs the city's largest construction company, Grisdale Building Co.

## Description
Jacob is in his mid-forties and his years working in construction have left him powerfully built. He has short blonde hair and a thick, well groomed beard. He dresses very plainly, with a holy symbol of Torm (a white right gauntlet) clearly visible around his neck at all times.

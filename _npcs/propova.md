  She seeks to lead the Aghara in destabilizing the city's infastructure and creating freedom for its people in chaos.

  ## Description
  Tall, powerfully built. She wears black armour with grey trims made of leather with metal plating. She is hooded and her face is covered by a white mask featuring the Aghara mark in bright red on the forehead. She carries no visible weapons.

  ## Personality
  Propova is incredibly charismatic. Her words flow off her tongue with ease and easily convince others of her beliefs. She appears kind, generous, and sincere. However, as soons as she is crossed, or others get in the way, she becomes cold, heartless, and willing to do anything to remove them as an obstacle.

  Propova truly believes that tearing down the established systems within Port George will bring freedom to the city. Although she is being funded and manipulated by members of the Pijavka, she is unaware that they have goals beyond hers and are simply using her as a way to cause chaos in the city.

Sells all your basic needs for short voyages or fishing trips.

General Supplies is a long standing institution in the Shoreline. Cap is an incredibly old elf. So old that he is actually showing age and resembles a human senior. No one knows for sure if he was ever actually a captain of a ship, but they all call him Cap'n just the same.

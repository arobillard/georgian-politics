Owned by the [Academia del Umbra Arcana]({{site.baseurl}}/locations/academia-del-umbra-arcana), this stores sells enchanted items created by students of the college that are deemed safe for sale to the public, but not useful to the college.

They also accept commissions for specific items at a discounted rate. The enchantments are done by the students so the results are not always as expected, which is why a discount is given.

The store is run by a rotating collection of students and their supervisor {{page.owner}}.

This belt is made of tightly woven blue and black leather strands. It looks like an ordinary belt until a strap is pulled along the edge of the belt which reveals eight different colour gems embedded into the length of the belt.

The wearer of the belt may expend a spell slot and store a spell within the belt. The wearer may then cast the spell stored in the belt at a later time without spending another spell slot. The spell remains stored within the belt until the wearer chooses to cast the spell via the belt or until the item become unattuned. Each color gem on the belt represents a school of magic and only one spell per school of magic may be contained within the belt at a time.

The belt cannot store any spell that has a casting time beyond 1 action. When storing any spell that consumes a spell component with a GP value (such as the 300gp diamond for Revivify), the spell components are consumed when the spell is stored in the belt.

The belt has a limit of how much magical power it can contain. The current limit is **8 spell levels**. If the wearer attempts to store a spell that will put the total stored spells above the current limit, they must make an Intelligence check. On a success, the limit is permanently increased to the total spell levels of all spells stored. On a fail, the spell slot is lost and the spell is not stored in the belt.

> For example: the current limit of spell levels is 8. If three 2nd level spells are stored in the belt totaling 6 spell levels and a 3rd level spell is then successfully added to belt, the level limit is permanently increased to 9 spell levels.

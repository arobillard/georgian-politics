The blade of this elegant longsword is translucent and shimmers as if made of solid ice, with a thin vapor constantly drifting off of the blade. Its handle is made of gold with a number of ancient runes and patterns carved into it.

Chillrend is a +2 longsword. On hit it deals 1d8 slashing (Versatile 1d10) plus and additional 1d6 cold damage. Once per day, the weilder may use an action to stab Chillrend into the ground. Each creature within a 20ft radius must succeed a DC 13 Constitution ST or take 1d6 cold damage. The area within the 20ft radius also becomes icy and slick and is considered difficult terrain for 1 minute. Creatures that are flying/levitating/not moving on the ground are unaffected by the rough terrain.

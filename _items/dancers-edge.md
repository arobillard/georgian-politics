This golden blade glimmers as it moves effortlessly through the air. Even as you swing it for the first time that there is a new found elegance in the way you move.

The Dancer's Edge is a +1 rapier. It has three charges and regains 1d3 charges after a long rest. You may use a charge to cause one of the following effects:

- After a successful hit with the Dancer's Edge, you may use 1 charge as a bonus action to attempt to compel the target to dance for one minute. The target must succeed a DC 13 Wisdom throw or else the target begins to tell a wordless emotional story from their past through interpretive dance. While dancing, the target is incapacitated. The target may repeat the saving through at the end of each of their turns and any time they take damage (except from another attack made by the Dancer's Edge).
- You can use 1 charge to further imbue yourself with a dancer's elegance and to take the Dodge action as a bonus action.

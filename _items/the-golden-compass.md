The Golden Compass is a small golden sphere about an inch in diameter. As a bonus action, the holder can twist the sphere along the centre seem and divide it into two pieces. Each half features a compass needle which magically points towards the other piece.

The range of The Golden Compass has not been fully tested, but pieces have continued to work as far as 5 miles apart in the past.

When inserted into a keyhole or lock, this device becomes invisible and magically enhances the lock, making it harder to pick (increasing the DC by 5). Anyone who fails at picking a lock sealed by Skriveno's Sneaky Sealer and must succeed a Constitution ST or take 3d6 force damage or half as much on a success.

The device is only capable of discharging once per day, however continues to enhance the lock after discharging. Upon discharge after a failed lock pick, there is a 25% chance that the device will break and fully jam the lock.

Owned by the [Huntingtons](../../families/huntington/), the brewery brews Honeybrew, the most popular mead in Port George. They also brew a range of other popular drinks including Oaksap (whiskey), Golden Apple (cider), and Trailblazer (ale). The brewery and estate is located west of the city and south of the Gate Way road.

Although achieving great success and wealth, the Huntingtons mostly stays out of the affairs of high society. Instead of having a home in City's Crest, they have created a large estate on their farmlands attached to the brewery, preferring to spend most of their time there.

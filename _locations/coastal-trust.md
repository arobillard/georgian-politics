This massive bank is the headquarters of The Coastal Trust, which is a massive network of banks that serve numerous cities in Creag Mh√≤r. Located at the intersection of The Drain and Scholar's Row, the white marble building is the largest in all of the Market district. In a courtyard infront of the building is the Merchant's Fortune Fountain. It is tradition before confirming a large trade or business deal to throw a gold piece or two into the fountain for good luck. All the money collected is donated to [Healing Waters](../district-of-the-divine/#healing-waters).

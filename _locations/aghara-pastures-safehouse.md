## Introduction
This location serves as the staging ground for a large number of the attacks on caravans through [The Pastures]({{site.baseurl}}/locations/the-pastures). It is also being set up as a fallback location for [Aghara members]({{site.baseurl}}/factions/aghara/) to hide once they move into the open combat portion of their plan.

## Rooms

### 1 - Staging Room, Tunnel A
A small cave-like room featuring a table with a few chairs. A deck of cards in mid game lays spread on the table as well as <span class="text-primary bold">3d6 x 10sp</span>. There are a couple mostly empty barrels of oil at the back of the room, as well as <span class="text-primary bold">1d6 empty bottles</span> and various scraps of clothes. There is currently no one in the room.

### 2 - Staging Room, Tunnel B
A small cave-like room featuring a table with a few chairs. There are a couple mostly empty barrels of oil at the back of the room, as well as <span class="text-primary bold">1d6 empty bottles</span> and various scraps of clothes. There is currently no one in the room.

### 3 - Warehouse
This room is 60x40ft and is well light and properly built with stone walls, floor and ceiling. It appears to be a storage facility, there are numerous boxes, crates, and barrels in various states of being packed, unpacked, and organized. There is a heavy metal on the south wall to the east and a large set of double doors on the south wall to the west. On the west wall is a second set of double doors.

The crates contain food, construction and mining supplies (stamped with a variety of businesses, they were likely stolen in small batches to avoid notice), basic weapons and arms.

### 3b - Teleportation Circle Room
This room is also mostly filled with crates, boxes, and barrels, although much more neatly packed and seem ready to be shipped. The contents are similar as to the main warehouse.

At the southern end of the room is a teleportation circle. The teleportation circle glows a deep red and at the centre of the sigil markings is a bright glowing mark of the Aghara. In order to pass through the teleportation circle, one must be branded by the Aghara. Anyone who attempts to step into it without a brand must make a DC 20 Constitution ST. On a failed save, suffer 4d6 Force damage or half as much on a success.

### 4 - Vault
The vault is sealed by a large metal door. It requires a DC 18 Thieves Tools check or use of the key held by the Knight in order to open. The vault contains the following:
- 6 gems worth 25gp
- 400cp, 8,000sp, 2,200gp, 70pp
- Potion of Invisibility
- Potion of Greater Healing

### 5 - Hallway
Approximately 90ft long and 20ft wide. Along the north wall is a closed door and an open archway. On the south wall are three doorways. On the west wall is a door. To the north and south of the door on the west wall are rough looking tunnels.

### 6 - Barracks
Across the 4 rooms is enough bedding for approximately 120 people. A keen observer (DC 15 Investigation check) will notice that the majority of the beds have yet to be used. A thorough search of a few of the rooms will uncover <span class="text-primary bold">4d6gp</span> worth of silver pieces, various bits of common clothing, and 2 daggers.

### 7 - Mess Hall
A large mess hall. It appears that the cooking area is not fully complete in its construction. However, when complete it looks like it would have the capacity to easily feed the amount of people this shelter can house. Barrels and crates of food can be found along the east wall and a modest meal for the current residents is in the process of being prepared.

### 8 - Knight's Quarters
This room features a desk, a table with a couple chairs, a mostly empty bookcase, a modest, but comfortable bed, and empty armour stand, and a chest. The bookcase contains a few general history books of the area, a book titled "An Argument for Freedom" by Elnullia, and a few engineering and mining books. The chest is mostly clothing of mid-level quality and a pouch of <span class="text-primary bold">50gp</span>. The table has the remains of a meal. On the desk is journal and a half- written letter. The journal contains logs of the various wares that have come through the warehouse recently. It lists items they have stolen in small bunches from nearby farms, traveling caravans, and different shops from around the pastures. It outlines how they steal small amounts of goods from carts amidst the chaos of burning and attack the wagons. Their goal seemed to be to mask the fact that they were stockpiling goods and make it seem like they were merely burning everything. The half-written letter is written in <span class="text-primary bold">Deep Speech</span> and reads:

> Propova,
>
> We are working on the final touches of the construction of the <mark>southwest</mark> Pastures safehouse. It should be complete within the next few days and ready to serve its full capacity at that time.
>
> We are nearly ready for the next stage of the plan. This letter arrives with the final shipment of weapons and resources necessary for the attack. Once they are sent and I have completed final preparations here, I will meet...

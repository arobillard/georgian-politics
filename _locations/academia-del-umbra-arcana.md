A large arcane university which takes up a almost half of the district on the northern end of the district. The university trains students looking to excel at the arcane, conducts research, and provides enchanting at a discounted rate through [Academia's Apprentice Goods]({{site.baseurl}}/stores/academias-apprentice-goods/) (enchantments are created by students so results are mixed and destruction of items a very real possibility).

#### Professors:
- Delwee (female elf), head of enchanting services
- Letwoon (male halfing) head of research
- Unklel (female half orc) head of admissions
- Illian (female half elf) head of alchemist

#### Students:

- Ed (gender fluid dwarf) enchanter
- Jed (male gnome) enchanter

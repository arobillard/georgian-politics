A large arcane university which takes up a almost half of the district on the northern end of the district. The university trains students looking to excel at the arcane, conducts research, and provides enchanting at a discounted rate through [Academia's Apprentice Goods]({{site.baseurl}}/stores/academias-apprentice-goods/) (enchantments are created by students so results are mixed and destruction of items a very real possibility).

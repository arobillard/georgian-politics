## Introduction
Scholar's Row features a number of educational institutions. The largest is the [Academia del Umbra Arcana](#academia-del-umbra-arcana), which is dedicated to pursuing the secrets of the arcane arts. Other institutions include the [Archives of the Deep](#archives-of-the-deep) and the [Museum of Georgian History](#museum-of-georgian-history).

## Demographics
The majority of this district is taken up by campuses of the Academia de Umbra Arcana and the Archives of the Deep. The campuses include some housing for students and faculty, but beyond that there are few residential buildings. Most people who frequent this area a academics. The Scholar's Row road, which is the main road leading towards Port George's northern gate, has a large amount of traffic. This occaisionally causes tension between the academic members of the district and those transporting goods along the road and out the gate to the Pastures and other destinations.

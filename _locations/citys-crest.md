## Introduction
Home of the city's elite, powerful, and wealthy, City's Crest is a beautiful district that likes to show off its wealth. The houses are large and often hidden behind walls.
## Demographics
The majority of the residents can trace their lineage back many generations within the same estates of City's Crest. City's Crest is not closed off to the rest of the citizens of Port George. However, those who enter into the district are closely watched by Guards at the districts gates. Therefore it is one of the safest districts with a very low rate of (street) crime.

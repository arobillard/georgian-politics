The biggest and wealthiest winery in the Pastures. Owned by the [Findren Estate](../../families/findren/), this winery has been making wine that has been on the tables of Castle Caan since King George I. Their winery is closely guard by both private mercenary and towns guard alike, guarding generations of wine making secrets.

  Although they have their high end expensive wines that few but the richest in Port George can afford, they also produce cheaper wines targeted at the middle and lower classes (although branded and labeled differently as Cracked Cliff Wines to avoid association). This venture actually provides the Findren Estate with much more income than the high quality wines.

  The Findren Estate has invested a large amount of money into developing lower income areas and generating jobs and is currently in the good graces of most of the Port George residents. Although their intentions seem good and overall they are providing a service to the city, some keen observers might notice that the increase in wages amongst the poor has also means an increase in the sales of Cracked Cliff Wines.

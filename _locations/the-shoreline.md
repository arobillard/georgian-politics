## Introduction
The Shoreline is an incredibly busy district, work begins at the early hours of the morning and runs late into the evening. It regularly sees visitors from other lands looking to trade or stop and resupply along their voyages. The district sits outside of the city wall as a form of protection for the rest of the city.

## Demographics
The northern eighth of the Shoreline features mainly passenger vessels. The next eighth are the docks dedicated to the fishing industry. The southern quarter of the Shoreline houses the Crown Navy shipyard. The middle section, talking up half of the Shoreline are the docks dedicated to the massive amount of trade vessels that routinely depart and arrive from Port George. The district is mainly a commercial district, with few residential buildings beyond those of established shipmasters and a few taverns and inns.

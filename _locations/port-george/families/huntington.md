      The Huntington Family owns a large brewery in [The Pastures](../../districts/the-pastures) which produces a range of meads, ales, ciders, etc. that are very popular. Although achieving great success and wealth, the Huntington Family mostly stays out of the affairs of high society. Instead of having a home in City's Crest, they have created a large estate on their farmlands, preferring to spend most of their time there.

## Introduction {#introduction}
The market district marks the centre of town where all the districts meet. The large main roads of the town intersect here creating a road known as *The Circle*. Within The Circle is a large [statue of the Goddess Nocea](#statue-of-nocea) and surrounding the ring there are layers of stalls and tents selling wares and goods. Beyond the tents numerous shops extend further into the market district.

## Notable Landmarks {#notable-landmarks}

In the centre of The Circle is a 60' high, marble statue of the Goddess Nocea. Nocea is standing slightly hunched with her face in her hands as if crying. She wears a flowing dress featuring patterns of waves, the moon, stars, sea creatures, and ships.

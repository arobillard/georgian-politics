  - title: Introduction
    content: Surrounding the entirety of the city of Port George, The Pastures are a massive expanse of farmlands. The crops produced by The Pastures are more than enough to feed the city's residents and many of the surrounding cities.

      The pastures surround the outside of the city walls for miles. Hundreds of farms produce the massive amount of food needed to sustain the hunger of the city and its trade ventures. A few simple blacksmiths and wood crafters combine to make small gathering points and communities known as Farmunes within the pastures. A system of watch towers scattered throughout The Pastures keeps watch over the farmland and provides the city with advance warning of any trouble (though it is rarely put to use).
  - title: Crop Yield
    content: >-
      The Pastures produce a large variety and quantity of crops. All manner of grain and vegetables. There are large farms dedicated to raising animals both for slaughter and for milk and their products. The southern portion of the district that hugs the cliffs to the sea feature large vineyards and wineries. There are numerous orchards and fruit farms.


      The variety of crops that the Pastures provide is beyond anything which most agricultural areas should be able to provide. The quantity is also well beyond average. Within the last 20 years the pastures have nearly doubled in size. Each years harvest has been more bountiful than the year before and the crops seem to grow without issue regardless of weather. Because of this food is abundant within Port George and the population is well fed. The Pastures also provide a huge amount of employment for the city. The large amount of growth in employment and food availability over the past two decades is believed to be directly causing the reduction in crime within the city and The Basin specifically.

          Because the Pastures have grown so large, it is hard for workers and resources to travel to the farms and back to the city quickly. Many of the farms require most of a days travel to reach. Because of this small farming communities, referred to as "Farmunes" have popped up across the pastures. These Farmunes usually feature workers barracks (sometimes with a pub attached) where farm hands stay when on a work rotation, blacksmiths, craftsmen, and a general store.

          Watchtowers are spread out creating a network across the Pastures. They are able to signal each other, the city, and surrounding farms of danger. Most towers are stone structures around 60ft tall, have a rotating crew of 4 guards, basic lodging, and signal flags and fires.
      - title: Findren Winery
        content: >-
          The biggest and wealthiest winery in the Pastures. Owned by the [Findren Estate](../../families/findren/), this winery has been making wine that has been on the tables of Castle Caan since King George I. Their winery is closely guard by both private mercenary and towns guard alike, guarding generations of wine making secrets.


          Although they have their high end expensive wines that few but the richest in Port George can afford, they also produce cheaper wines targeted at the middle and lower classes (although branded and labeled differently as Cracked Cliff Wines to avoid association). This venture actually provides the Findren Estate with much more income than the high quality wines.


          The Findren Estate has invested a large amount of money into developing lower income areas and generating jobs and is currently in the good graces of most of the Port George residents. Although their intentions seem good and overall they are providing a service to the city, some keen observers might notice that the increase in wages amongst the poor has also means an increase in the sales of Cracked Cliff Wines.

          Owned by the [Huntington Estate](../../families/huntington/), the brewery brews Honeybrew, the most popular mead in Port George. They also brew a range of other popular drinks including Oaksap (whiskey), Golden Apple (cider), and Trailblazer (ale). The brewery and estate is located west of the city south of the Gate Way.


          Although achieving great success and wealth, the Huntington Estate mostly stays out of the affairs of high society. Instead of having a home in City's Crest, they have created a large estate on their farmlands, preferring to spend most of their time there.

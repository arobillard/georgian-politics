    content: >-
      District of the Divine features numerous temples to a variety of gods. There is religious freedom within Port George (at least of those gods not commonly considered evil) so many temples worshipping different gods have been established. The two largest temples are those worshipping Nocea, Goddess of the Ocean, and Daln, God of Earth and Agriculture. In recent years, the temple worshipping Nocea has dwindled in power, whereas the temple to Daln has grown.

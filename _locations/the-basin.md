## Introduction
Historically known as the Basin because it is the lower point in the city, both in terms of social status and physical height. Its residents have struggled a lot over the years. However, due to the economic growth within the city at large, the residents currently live in a state of relative comfort.

## Demographics
The poorest and most dangerous area of Port George. In recent years has stabilized, however there is still a fair amount of petty crime and muggings. It is not wise to walk alone at night. Inhabitants include petty criminals, low level servants of the upper class, young sailors, farm hands, and new immigrants and refugees of other lands.

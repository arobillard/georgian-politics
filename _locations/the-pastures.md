  ## CoB Council Member
  [The Scarecrow](/factions/council-of-the-bruins/#the-scarecrow) aka [Eugenie Huntington](../../families/huntington/), eldest daughter of Hubert Huntington and heir to the Huntingtons. Eugenie is well versed in the affairs of the brewery and through the Huntington's dealings with the various farms is well connected and knowledgeable of the goings on across most of the Pastures.
  ## Crop Yield
  The variety of crops that the Pastures provide is beyond anything which most agricultural areas should be able to provide. The quantity is also well beyond average. Within the last 20 years the pastures have nearly doubled in size. Each years harvest has been more bountiful than the year before and the crops seem to grow without issue regardless of weather. Because of this food is abundant within Port George and the population is well fed. The Pastures also provide a huge amount of employment for the city. The large amount of growth in employment and food availability over the past two decades is believed to be directly causing the reduction in crime within the city and The Basin specifically.

## Introduction
Surrounding the entirety of the city of Port George, The Pastures are a massive expanse of farmlands. The crops produced by The Pastures are more than enough to feed the city's residents and many of the surrounding cities.

## Demographics
The pastures surround the outside of the city walls for miles. Hundreds of farms produce the massive amount of food needed to sustain the hunger of the city and its trade ventures. A few simple blacksmiths and wood crafters combine to make small gathering points and communities known as Farmunes within the pastures. A system of watch towers scattered throughout The Pastures keeps watch over the farmland and provides the city with advance warning of any trouble (though it is rarely put to use).

## Crop Yield
The Pastures produce a large variety and quantity of crops. All manner of grain and vegetables. There are large farms dedicated to raising animals both for slaughter and for milk and their products. The southern portion of the district that hugs the cliffs to the sea feature large vineyards and wineries. There are numerous orchards and fruit farms.

## Areas of interest
#### Farmunes
Because the Pastures have grown so large, it is hard for workers and resources to travel to the farms and back to the city quickly. Many of the farms require most of a days travel to reach. Because of this small farming communities, referred to as "Farmunes" have popped up across the pastures. These Farmunes usually feature workers barracks (sometimes with a pub attached) where farm hands stay when on a work rotation, blacksmiths, craftsmen, and general stores.

#### Watchtowers
Watchtowers are spread out creating a network across the Pastures. They are able to signal each other, the city, and surrounding farms of danger. Most towers are stone structures around 60ft tall, have a rotating crew of 4 guards, basic lodging, and signal flags and fires.
